## The story

Sometimes the best opportunities come from your mates. A friend of mine was building Lix, a data scraping Chrome extension, and needed someone to handle the frontend. I came on board as the sole frontend developer, responsible for both the marketing website and the extension interface itself.

## The challenges

Being the only frontend developer meant wearing all the hats - there was no one else to bounce ideas off or share the load. I had to set up everything from scratch: the development workflow, testing infrastructure, and the bridge between design and code. Working on a Chrome extension also brought its own quirks - you're building within the constraints of browser APIs whilst trying to keep the user experience smooth and intuitive.

## My favourite project

Setting up our component-driven development workflow was probably my proudest achievement at Lix. I introduced Storybook for component development and built out automated testing, which cut our QA cycles in half. It might not sound glamorous, but when you're a small startup moving fast, halving the time from development to deployment is massive.

## Most impactful work

Working directly with the founder, I established our design-to-development workflow, translating Figma designs into production code. We created a rhythm where designs could move from concept to implementation smoothly, which is crucial when you're trying to iterate quickly in a startup environment. This workflow became the foundation for how we shipped features, and honestly, it felt like we were building the plane whilst flying it - in the best possible way.
